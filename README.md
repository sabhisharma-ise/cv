# CV
This repository contains the source code for my CV website, which I created during my Web Development Course.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this using the following command:

Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the index.html file in a web browser to view the website.

## Customizing the Website
The website is highly customizable. You can change the colors, fonts, and layout to match your own style. You can also add additional content, such as a blog, portfolio, or contact information.

To customize the website, you will need to edit the index.html file. The file is written in HTML and CSS, so you will need to have some knowledge of these languages to make changes.
